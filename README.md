# Flight-Delays-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Introduction

Flight delays are a common occurrence in the aviation industry, causing significant inconvenience to passengers and disruptions to airline operations. Accurate prediction of flight delays can enable airlines to proactively manage resources, communicate effectively with passengers, and potentially mitigate the impact of delays. Machine learning offers a powerful approach to address this challenge by leveraging historical data and complex patterns to forecast flight delays with reasonable accuracy.

Key Challenges and Objectives

Complexity of Factors: Flight delays are influenced by a multitude of factors, including weather conditions, air traffic congestion, aircraft maintenance issues, and operational constraints.

Data Availability: Access to comprehensive and reliable datasets is crucial for training effective machine learning models.

Prediction Accuracy: The goal is to develop models that can accurately predict flight delays, providing airlines with sufficient time to implement contingency plans.

Algorithms Used:
1. Decision Tree
2. kNN
